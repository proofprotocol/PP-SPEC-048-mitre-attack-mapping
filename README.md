# PP-SPEC-048: Proof of Efficacy Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise

**Status:** DRAFT v0.1

## Purpose

This repository defines a Proof Protocol mapping between the MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise matrix and Proof Protocol evidence, efficacy, and proof semantics.

MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise (mapped against v19.2) is treated as a pluggable source of adversary tactic, technique, and detection context. Proof Protocol remains framework-agnostic and independently establishes whether a selected control performed as claimed.

## Architectural principle

> **Threat frameworks are pluggable inputs to Proof Protocol. Proof Protocol is framework-agnostic.**

External frameworks identify what may be tested. Proof Protocol independently establishes whether a control worked and what evidence proves the result.
